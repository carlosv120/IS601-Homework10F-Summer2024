## Conclusion about the Homework

This assignment has been challenging since the first moment. I felt exactly as I did on my first day at my current companyâ€”like being thrown into the forest with a knife. The code was completely new to me, and I didn't even know where to start checking. It was my experience working with endpoints and real-world debugging that helped me navigate this journey. My debugging skills were definitely challenged in this assignment. Reading errors and tracing back the code path helped me understand more and more how this project was structured. I do this on a daily basis in my job, but even with zero familiarity with the project, I was able to handle the process and find solutions.

I feel that the most complicated part was the initial phase of the project, understanding how the project is structured. Once I found a bug, the following steps were like breadcrumbs, leading me to understand what was happening and how it could be solved. I could see where the response bodies were generated and how to modify them to satisfy requirements or improve the user experience.

I think I could have done a better job when defining issues, descriptions, and solutions. However, since time was a factor, I didn't produce my best work on those requirements. It's something very similar to what happens at my job; sometimes I feel unsure about a bug/procedure due to low familiarity with the code, and I tend to make mistakes in providing exact bullet points on what is happening and how to solve it. This is a skill I need to work on because when I have time to dive into the code, I can provide better issues (defects and stories) for coworkers or, in this case, graders and/or professors.

This assignment helped me gain more experience with Python more than anything because I am familiar with the overall process of finding defects, documenting them, and solving them with all the required steps.

## Note for grader

I created more than 5 issues, but I didn't include them in this Readme file as they are not purely related to what was required. However, I will include the link in case you want to take a look.
